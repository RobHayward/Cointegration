the DW test is in the 'Raw.R' file.  The book will explain what all the variables are and how they can be used to estimate the best model.  This can then be put into the Main.Rnw file.  

Needs to be complete. Needs to add the Dicky Fuller reference and the full information about the test of coefficients with test statistics phi and rho.
